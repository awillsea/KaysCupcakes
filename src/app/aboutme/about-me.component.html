    <h2>Introduction:</h2>

            <h2>How It All Began</h2>
            <p>
            Let's rewind the clock to when I first became a grandmotherâ€”the starting point for Kays Confections.   
            It all began with the simple joy of family gatherings and the desire to make those moments even
            sweeter. As I navigated the delightful chaos of grandparenthood, a passion for crafting delicious
            desserts sprouted naturally. Kays Confections emerged from these humble beginnings, a small venture
            fueled by the love that defines family and the simple pleasures of homemade treats.
